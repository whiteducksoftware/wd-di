# Design Guide and Tutorial

Looking at numerous Python repositories, one thing is clear: the gap between good and terrible code is more pronounced in Python than in any other language. In no other language will you find highly-downloaded libraries with such questionable software design decisions and architecture.

Python is a flexible language, and everyone should embrace this flexibility. However, flexibility should not be an excuse for avoiding clean and structured architecture, because there comes a point in every developer's life when they become overwhelmed by their own library and the past decisions they made.

This is an attempt to increase awareness of dependency injection - specifically the way we prefer to use it (the .NET style) and how we implement it when building real software. Dependency injection is an often neglected topic, which is reason enough for us to show you the amazing things it enables you to do.

WD-DI isn't just a tool for resolving dependenciesâ€”it's a foundation for designing well-structured applications. Follow these guidelines and examples to leverage dependency injection in your project.

The first part explains the theory behind the DI pattern, while the second part implements a small application built on these principles!

By following this design guide, you can use WD-DI as the backbone for a well-architected, modular, and testable software system. Embrace dependency injection to:

- **Decouple components** using constructor injection.
- **Implement interface-driven design** for flexible, swappable components.
- **Centralize cross-cutting concerns** with a middleware pipeline.
- **Manage configurations** via strongly-typed options.
- **Enhance testability** by isolating dependencies and using mocks.
- **Build layered architectures** that scale and evolve gracefully.

This guide, with its accompanying code examples, provides a roadmap for integrating WD-DI into your projects, ensuring that your architecture remains robust, maintainable, and adaptable over time.

## Design Guide: Architecting Your Software with WD-DI

### 1. Separation of Concerns

**Principle:**  
Break your application into components with clear responsibilities. Use constructor injection to make dependencies explicit and decouple components.

**Example:**

```python
from wd.di import ServiceCollection

services = ServiceCollection()

# EmailService: A service responsible for sending emails
class EmailService:
    def send_email(self, recipient: str, subject: str, body: str):
        print(f"Sending email to {recipient}")
services.add_singleton(EmailService)

# UserService: Depends on EmailService for notifications
@services.singleton()
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, email_service: EmailService):
        self.email_service = email_service

    def notify(self, user_id: str, message: str):
        # In a real app, fetch user's email from a repository, etc.
        self.email_service.send_email("user@example.com", "Notification", message)

# Register and use the services:
provider = services.build_service_provider()
user_service = provider.get_service(UserService)
user_service.notify("123", "Your order has shipped!")
```

**When to use:**  
Apply separation of concerns to keep business logic distinct from infrastructure (e.g., sending emails, logging), making your code easier to maintain and test.

---

### 2. Component-Based Design

**Interface-Driven Development**

**Principle:**  
Define interfaces (or abstract base classes) and register implementations against these interfaces. This allows you to swap implementations and write cleaner tests.

**Example:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from wd.di import ServiceCollection

services = ServiceCollection()

# Define an interface for user repository
class IUserRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_user(self, user_id: str):
        pass

# Implementation of the repository interface
@services.singleton(IUserRepository)
class UserRepository(IUserRepository):
    def get_user(self, user_id: str):
        return {"id": user_id, "name": "John Doe"}

# Register the interface and its implementation:
```

**Lifetimes Matter**

**Principle:**  
Select service lifetimes based on the nature of the dependency:
- **Transient:** New instance per request.
- **Singleton:** One instance for the entire application.
- **Scoped:** One instance per defined scope (e.g., per web request).

**Example:**

```python
# Transient: A new instance is created each time
# Assuming IService and ServiceImpl are defined elsewhere for this snippet
# services.add_transient(IService, ServiceImpl)

# Singleton: One instance is shared application-wide
# services.add_singleton(IService, ServiceImpl)

# Scoped: One instance per explicit scope
# services.add_scoped(IService, ServiceImpl)

# More concrete example using decorators:
# @services.transient()
# class MyTransientService(IService): pass
# @services.singleton()
# class MySingletonService(IService): pass
# @services.scoped()
# class MyScopedService(IService): pass
```

**When to use:**  
Use interface-driven design to enhance flexibility and testing. Choose lifetimes based on resource usage and desired sharing.

---

### 3. Middleware for Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Principle:**  
Centralize and modularize common tasks (logging, authentication, error handling) using a middleware pipeline.

**Example:**

```python
from wd.di import ServiceCollection, MiddlewarePipeline
from wd.di.middleware import IMiddleware

services = ServiceCollection()

# A simple logging middleware that wraps request processing
class LoggingMiddleware(IMiddleware):
    async def invoke(self, context, next):
        print("Request started")
        result = await next()
        print("Request finished")
        return result

# Configure the middleware pipeline:
app = services.create_application_builder()
app.configure_middleware(lambda builder: (
    builder.use_middleware(LoggingMiddleware)
))
provider = app.build()
pipeline = provider.get_service(MiddlewarePipeline)

# Simulated context for demonstration:
class DummyContext:
    is_authenticated = True

import asyncio
async def run_pipeline():
    result = await pipeline.execute(DummyContext())
    return result

# asyncio.run(run_pipeline()) # Commented out for non-blocking snippet
```

**When to use:**  
Utilize middleware for tasks that apply to many or all requests, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.

---

### 4. Robust Configuration Management

**Principle:**  
Centralize configuration using strongly-typed options. This provides compile-time checks and clearer configuration structures.

**Example:**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from wd.di import ServiceCollection
from wd.di.config import Configuration, Options, IConfiguration

services = ServiceCollection()

@dataclass
class AppConfig:
    debug: bool = False
    api_key: str = ""

# Create and register configuration
app_specific_config = Configuration({
    "app": {
        "debug": True,
        "apiKey": "secret-key"
    }
})

services.add_singleton_factory(IConfiguration, lambda _: app_specific_config)
services.configure(AppConfig, section="app")

# Example service that uses configuration:
@services.singleton()
class AppService:
    def __init__(self, options: Options[AppConfig]):
        self.config = options.value

    def run(self):
        if self.config.debug:
            print("Running in debug mode")
        else:
            print("Running in production mode")

provider = services.build_service_provider()
app_service = provider.get_service(AppService)
app_service.run()
```

**When to use:**  
Adopt strongly-typed configuration to centralize and validate settings, reducing errors and simplifying environment-specific configuration.

---

### 5. Enhancing Testability and Maintainability

**Principle:**  
Using DI improves testability by allowing easy injection of mocks or stubs. Constructor injection makes dependencies explicit and testing straightforward.

**Example:**

```python
# (Assuming UserService and EmailService definitions from previous examples,
# with UserService decorated with @services.singleton() and EmailService also registered)

# A mock version of EmailService for testing purposes
class MockEmailService:
    def send_email(self, recipient, subject, body):
        print("Mock email sent")

# Testing UserService with a mock dependency:
def test_user_service():
    # Manually instantiate UserService with the mock. 
    # This is for unit testing the UserService logic in isolation.
    # The actual EmailService (if needed by UserService) would be DI-injected in real app.
    user_service = UserService(email_service=MockEmailService())
    user_service.notify("123", "Test Message")

test_user_service()
```

**When to use:**  
Enhance testability by isolating components and substituting real implementations with mocks during unit tests.

---

### 6. Evolving Architecture with WD-DI

**Layered Application Architecture**

**Principle:**  
Structure your application into layers (Domain, Data Access, Presentation, Infrastructure) and use DI to manage dependencies between layers.

**Example:**

(Assuming `from wd.di import ServiceCollection` and `services = ServiceCollection()` are defined at the beginning of the script/module context for these snippets)

**Domain Layer:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IOrderService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_order(self, order_id: str):
        pass

@services.singleton(IOrderService) # Updated decorator
class OrderService(IOrderService):
    def process_order(self, order_id: str):
        print(f"Processing order {order_id}")
```

**Data Access Layer:**

```python
# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod # Already imported above

class IOrderRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_order(self, order_id: str):
        pass

@services.singleton(IOrderRepository) # Updated decorator
class OrderRepository(IOrderRepository):
    def get_order(self, order_id: str):
        return {"id": order_id, "item": "Book"}
```

**Presentation Layer:**

```python
@services.transient() # Updated decorator (OrderController typically transient)
class OrderController:
    def __init__(self, order_service: IOrderService):
        self.order_service = order_service

    def handle_order(self, order_id: str):
        self.order_service.process_order(order_id)
```

**Infrastructure Layer:**

```python
# External logging service via instance registration
class Logger:
    def log(self, msg: str):
        print(f"LOG: {msg}")

logger_instance = Logger()
services.add_instance(Logger, logger_instance) # Uses the 'services' instance
```

**Assembling the Application:**

```python
# Register layers with the DI container:
# These are now redundant if decorators on classes specify interfaces:
# services.add_singleton(IOrderService, OrderService)
# services.add_singleton(IOrderRepository, OrderRepository)
# services.add_transient(OrderController) # OrderController is registered by its decorator

provider = services.build_service_provider()
controller = provider.get_service(OrderController)
controller.handle_order("order123")
```

**When to use:**  
Build a layered architecture using WD-DI to cleanly separate business logic, data access, presentation, and infrastructure concerns. This enhances maintainability and scalability.

---

### 7. Practical Advice for Evolving Architectures

**Start Simple, Then Expand**

**Principle:**  
Begin with a minimal DI setup. As your project grows, add more sophisticated registration, resolution, and middleware configurations.

**Example:**

```python
# (Assuming services = ServiceCollection() is defined)
# (Assuming DatabaseService and UserService are defined and decorated)

# Start by registering core services (now likely done via decorators on the classes):
# services.add_singleton(DatabaseService) # If DatabaseService is @services.singleton()
# services.add_singleton(UserService)    # If UserService is @services.singleton()

# Later, as the project evolves, integrate additional layers and middleware:
# (Assuming LoggingMiddleware is defined)
app = services.create_application_builder()
app.configure_middleware(lambda builder: (
    builder.use_middleware(LoggingMiddleware) # Assuming LoggingMiddleware can be resolved by DI
))
```

**When to use:**  
Adopt an incremental approach. Begin with essential services and progressively integrate advanced patterns like middleware pipelines, dynamic configuration, and custom lifetime management.

### 8. Common Python Anti-Patterns and DI Solutions

**Principle:**  
Python's flexibility, while powerful, can lead to common architectural pitfalls. Using dependency injection helps avoid these anti-patterns and promotes maintainable code.

#### Global State and Singletons

**Anti-Pattern:**
```python
# global_config.py
class GlobalConfig:
    _instance = None
    
    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_key = "secret"
        self.debug = True

# Used everywhere in the codebase:
config = GlobalConfig.get_instance()
```

**DI Solution:**
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from wd.di import ServiceCollection # Added
from wd.di.config import Configuration, Options, IConfiguration # Added IConfiguration

services = ServiceCollection() # Added

@dataclass
class AppConfig:
    api_key: str
    debug: bool

# Assuming configuration is loaded and IConfiguration is registered e.g.:
# app_specific_config = Configuration({"app": {"api_key": "actual_key", "debug": True}})
# services.add_singleton_factory(IConfiguration, lambda _: app_specific_config)
services.configure(AppConfig, section="app")

@services.singleton() # Updated decorator
class ConfiguredService:
    def __init__(self, options: Options[AppConfig]):
        self.config = options.value
    
    def do_something(self):
        if self.config.debug:
            print("Debug mode")

# Register in your DI container
# services.add_singleton(ConfiguredService) # Redundant due to decorator
```

#### Hidden Dependencies and Import-Time Side Effects

**Anti-Pattern:**
```python
# database.py
import sqlite3

# Global connection created at import time
db = sqlite3.connect("app.db")

class UserRepository:
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        cursor = db.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
        return cursor.fetchone()

# Used elsewhere:
repo = UserRepository()
user = repo.get_user(123)
```

**DI Solution:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import sqlite3
from wd.di import ServiceCollection # Added

services = ServiceCollection() # Added

class IDatabase(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, query: str, params: tuple):
        pass

# Database implementation requires connection_string. We'll use a factory.
class Database(IDatabase):
    def __init__(self, connection_string: str):
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(connection_string)
    
    def execute(self, query: str, params: tuple):
        cursor = self.connection.cursor()
        return cursor.execute(query, params)

# Register Database using a factory to provide connection_string
services.add_singleton_factory(IDatabase, lambda sp: Database("app.db"))

@services.singleton() # Updated decorator for UserRepository
class UserRepository:
    def __init__(self, db: IDatabase):
        self.db = db
    
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        return self.db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))

# Register with DI:
# services.add_singleton(UserRepository) # Redundant due to decorator
```

#### Module-Level Logic and Circular Dependencies

**Anti-Pattern:**
```python
# user_service.py
from order_service import get_user_orders

def get_user_details(user_id):
    orders = get_user_orders(user_id)
    return {"id": user_id, "orders": orders}

# order_service.py
from user_service import get_user_details

def get_user_orders(user_id):
    user = get_user_details(user_id)  # Circular dependency!
    return [{"order_id": 1}]
```

**DI Solution:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
# Assuming services = ServiceCollection() is defined

class IOrderService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_user_orders(self, user_id: str) -> list:
        pass

class IUserService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_user_details(self, user_id: str) -> dict:
        pass

@services.singleton(IOrderService) # Updated decorator
class OrderService(IOrderService):
    def get_user_orders(self, user_id: str) -> list:
        return [{"order_id": 1}]

@services.singleton(IUserService) # Updated decorator
class UserService(IUserService):
    def __init__(self, order_service: IOrderService):
        self.order_service = order_service
    
    def get_user_details(self, user_id: str) -> dict:
        orders = self.order_service.get_user_orders(user_id)
        return {"id": user_id, "orders": orders}

# Register with DI (now redundant due to decorators with interfaces):
# services.add_singleton(IOrderService, OrderService)
# services.add_singleton(IUserService, UserService)
```

#### Monolithic Classes with Mixed Responsibilities

**Anti-Pattern:**
```python
class UserManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = sqlite3.connect("app.db")
        self.logger = logging.getLogger()
        self.mailer = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.example.com")
    
    def create_user(self, email, password):
        self.logger.info(f"Creating user: {email}")
        cursor = self.db.cursor()
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES (?, ?)",
                      (email, password))
        self.db.commit()
        
        self.mailer.sendmail(
            "system@example.com",
            email,
            "Welcome to our service!"
        )
```

**DI Solution:**
```python
# Assuming services = ServiceCollection() is defined
# Assuming IDatabase, Options[SmtpConfig], SmtpConfig, ILogger are defined and registered

@services.singleton() # Updated (or @services.singleton(IUserRepository) if IUserRepository exists)
class UserRepository:
    def __init__(self, db: IDatabase):
        self.db = db
    
    def create_user(self, email: str, password: str):
        self.db.execute(
            "INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES (?, ?)",
            (email, password)
        )

@services.singleton() # Updated (or @services.singleton(IEmailService) if IEmailService exists)
class EmailService:
    def __init__(self, smtp_config: Options[SmtpConfig]): # Assuming SmtpConfig and Options are set up
        self.config = smtp_config.value
    
    def send_welcome_email(self, email: str):
        # Email sending logic here
        pass

@services.singleton() # Updated
class UserService:
    def __init__(
        self,
        repository: UserRepository, # Or IUserRepository
        email_service: EmailService, # Or IEmailService
        logger: ILogger # Assuming ILogger is an interface and a Logger implementation is registered
    ):
        self.repository = repository
        self.email_service = email_service
        self.logger = logger
    
    def create_user(self, email: str, password: str):
        self.logger.info(f"Creating user: {email}")
        self.repository.create_user(email, password)
        self.email_service.send_welcome_email(email)
```

#### Static Methods and Utility Classes

**Anti-Pattern:**
```python
class PaymentUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_tax(amount):
        return amount * 0.2
    
    @staticmethod
    def validate_credit_card(number):
        return len(number) == 16

class OrderProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, amount, card_number):
        if PaymentUtils.validate_credit_card(card_number):
            total = amount + PaymentUtils.calculate_tax(amount)
            # Process payment...
```

**DI Solution:**
```python
# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod # Already imported or assumed
# Assuming services = ServiceCollection() is defined

class ITaxCalculator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_tax(self, amount: float) -> float:
        pass

class IPaymentValidator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def validate_credit_card(self, number: str) -> bool:
        pass

@services.singleton(ITaxCalculator) # Updated decorator
class DefaultTaxCalculator(ITaxCalculator):
    def calculate_tax(self, amount: float) -> float:
        return amount * 0.2

@services.singleton(IPaymentValidator) # Updated decorator
class DefaultPaymentValidator(IPaymentValidator):
    def validate_credit_card(self, number: str) -> bool:
        return len(number) == 16

@services.singleton() # Updated decorator
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(
        self,
        tax_calculator: ITaxCalculator,
        payment_validator: IPaymentValidator
    ):
        self.tax_calculator = tax_calculator
        self.payment_validator = payment_validator
    
    def process_payment(self, amount: float, card_number: str):
        if self.payment_validator.validate_credit_card(card_number):
            total = amount + self.tax_calculator.calculate_tax(amount)
            # Process payment...
```

**When to use:**
Apply these patterns when:
- You need to replace implementations for testing
- Your application configuration needs to change based on environment
- You want to avoid tight coupling between modules
- You need to manage complex object lifecycles
- You want to make dependencies explicit and traceable

## 1. Introduction

Dependency injection is a cornerstone of modern software architecture. It enables you to build loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable systems by decoupling the creation of objects from their usage. In this tutorial, we'll use WD-DI to build an Order Processing application that demonstrates:

- **Separation of concerns** via layered architecture.
- **Interface-driven design** to allow for flexibility and easy testing.
- **Robust configuration management** using strongly-typed options.
- **Middleware pipelines** for cross-cutting concerns (optional extension).
- **Proper management of service lifetimes** (transient, singleton, and scoped).

---

## 2. Application Overview

Our sample application, **OrderProcessor**, will:

- Accept and process an order.
- Validate and save the order.
- Notify the user via email.
- Log key actions throughout the process.

---

## 3. Project Structure

For clarity, our project is organized as follows:

```

```

---

## 4. Architectural Layers and Design

### Domain Layer

This layer defines your core business entities and contracts.

**File: `domain/models.py`**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Order:
    order_id: str
    item: str
    quantity: int
    price: float
```

**File: `domain/interfaces.py`**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IOrderRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save_order(self, order):
        pass

class IOrderService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_order(self, order):
        pass
```

---

### Data Access Layer

Handles persistence and data operations.

**File: `data/repository.py`**

```python
from domain.interfaces import IOrderRepository
from infrastructure.logging_service import Logger

class OrderRepository(IOrderRepository):
    def __init__(self, logger: Logger):
        self.logger = logger

    def save_order(self, order):
        self.logger.log(f"Order saved: {order.order_id}")
        # In a real application, implement database save logic here.
```

---

### Service Layer (Business Logic)

Encapsulates your core business rules.

**File: `services/order_service.py`**

```python
from domain.interfaces import IOrderService, IOrderRepository
from domain.models import Order
from infrastructure.logging_service import Logger

class OrderService(IOrderService):
    def __init__(self, repository: IOrderRepository, logger: Logger):
        self.repository = repository
        self.logger = logger

    def process_order(self, order: Order):
        self.logger.log(f"Processing order: {order.order_id}")
        # Business logic: validate order, process payment, etc.
        self.repository.save_order(order)
        self.logger.log(f"Order processed: {order.order_id}")
```

---

### Presentation Layer

Provides the interface to interact with your application (e.g., a CLI or web controller).

**File: `presentation/controller.py`**

```python
from domain.models import Order
from domain.interfaces import IOrderService

class OrderController:
    def __init__(self, order_service: IOrderService):
        self.order_service = order_service

    def submit_order(self, order_id, item, quantity, price):
        order = Order(order_id=order_id, item=item, quantity=quantity, price=price)
        self.order_service.process_order(order)
```

### Infrastructure Layer

Manages cross-cutting concerns like configuration and logging.

**File: `infrastructure/config.py`**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class AppConfig:
    debug: bool = False
    email_server: str = ""
```

**File: `infrastructure/logging_service.py`**

```python
class Logger:
    def log(self, message: str):
        print(f"[LOG]: {message}")
```

## 5. Wiring It All Up with WD-DI

Now we'll integrate everything using WD-DI. The following code in `main.py` demonstrates how to register your services and build the application.

**File: `main.py`**

```python
from wd.di import ServiceCollection # Updated import
from wd.di.config import Configuration, Options, IConfiguration # Added IConfiguration
from domain.interfaces import IOrderRepository, IOrderService # Added domain interface imports
# Assuming these classes are defined in their respective files as shown in the tutorial structure
from infrastructure.config import AppConfig
from infrastructure.logging_service import Logger
from data.repository import OrderRepository # Assuming this class will be decorated
from services.order_service import OrderService # Assuming this class will be decorated
from presentation.controller import OrderController # Assuming this class will be decorated

services = ServiceCollection() # Added

# Configure application settings
app_config_data = Configuration({ # Renamed variable
    "app": {
        "debug": True,
        "emailServer": "smtp.example.com"
    }
})
services.add_singleton_factory(IConfiguration, lambda _: app_config_data)
services.configure(AppConfig, section="app")

# Register infrastructure services
# Logger is a concrete class; add_instance makes it a singleton.
# Alternatively, Logger could be decorated with @services.singleton() in its own file.
services.add_instance(Logger, Logger())

# Register other layers/services.
# These are typically registered via decorators in their respective class definition files.
# For example, in data/repository.py:
#   @services.singleton(IOrderRepository)
#   class OrderRepository(IOrderRepository): ...
#
# So, the following explicit registrations in main.py become redundant if decorators are used:
# services.add_singleton(IOrderRepository, OrderRepository)
# services.add_singleton(IOrderService, OrderService)
# services.add_transient(OrderController)

# Ensure your classes (OrderRepository, OrderService, OrderController, Logger)
# are decorated appropriately in their definition files for the DI to resolve them.
# For this example, we assume they are, or you would register them here if not decorated.

# Build the service provider
provider = services.build_service_provider()

# Resolve the controller and simulate an order submission
controller = provider.get_service(OrderController)
controller.submit_order("order001", "Widget", 5, 19.99)
```

## 6. Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see log messages indicating each step of the order processing workflow, such as order submission, processing, and saving.

## 7. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've built a simple order processing application that demonstrates how to:

- **Separate concerns** by splitting the application into distinct layers.
- **Design using interfaces** and concrete implementations to achieve a flexible, testable codebase.
- **Manage configuration** through strongly-typed options.
- **Leverage WD-DI** to wire all components together, ensuring proper management of service lifetimes and dependencies.

By using WD-DI, you not only simplify dependency management but also establish a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications. This design tutorial shows that dependency injection is far more than a theoretical conceptâ€”it's a practical tool for crafting high-quality software architectures.
